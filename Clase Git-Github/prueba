            "text":"TASK: Analyze food delivery image description, customer complaint, order details, and merchant information to determine quality issues and charges if any.\n\nCompare the customer complaint against this image description: The image depicts a close-up of a quesadilla, which appears to be homemade or from a casual dining setting rather than a professional stock photo. The quesadilla is cut into triangular slices, with one slice being lifted by a hand, revealing its contents. The tortilla is golden brown with a slightly crispy texture, showing signs of being grilled or toasted. \n\nInside, the filling consists of melted cheese, which is stringy and gooey, stretching as the slice is lifted. There are also visible pieces of shredded meat, likely beef or pork, adding a hearty texture to the dish. The meat appears tender and well-cooked, with a slightly darker color contrasting against the pale cheese. \n\nThe background shows a glimpse of a metallic tray or container, suggesting the quesadilla might be part of a larger meal or takeout order. The lighting is natural and unfiltered, emphasizing the homemade or casual nature of the setting. The overall presentation is appetizing, with the focus on the rich, savory filling and the perfectly toasted tortilla., cross-reference with the attached image(s), and use the provided order details and merchant name for further validation.\n\nMERCHANT: Underdog Sports Bar & Grill (Paxton St)\n\nINPUT:\n- Customer Comments: \"Was given a quesadilla instead on cheesesteak\"\n- Order Details: Traditional Wings (6 Pcs.)  x1  $10.00\nOptions  Lemon Pepper (Dry Rub), Hot BBQ\nSpecial Instructions\nSubstitution Instructions substitute\n\nCheeseburger  x1  $11.00\nOptions  Regular Fries, Well Done Beef Patty\nSpecial Instructions\nSubstitution Instructions  substitute\n\nCheesesteak  x1  $11.00\nOptions  Whole\nSpecial Instructions\nSubstitution Instructions  substitute\n\nBacon Cheese Fries  x1  $7.00\nOptions  Melted Cheddar, Waffle\nSpecial Instructions\nSubstitution Instructions  substitute\n\nCONSIDER:\n- Use the **Order Details** to verify:\n    - If the item received matches what was ordered (name, size, expected presentation)\n    - If any **special instructions** were followed\n    - If any **substitution requests** were honored or ignored\n- Use the **Merchant Name** to:\n    - Verify if the food shown appears to be from the correct merchant\n    - Help determine whether the customer may have received the wrong order or from a different restaurant\n    - Look up known item descriptions (e.g. if customer mentions \"flake storm\", validate if the photo matches that item based on the merchant's offering)\n\nDEFECT CATEGORIES (Select ONE or use \"N/A\"):\n1. \"Poor photo quality (blurry, dark, irrelevant)\"\n2. \"Miscategorized\"\n3. \"Incorrect item received\"\n4. \"Incorrect size\"\n5. \"Explicit Photo/Comment\"\n6. \"N/A\" — for clear issues like substitutions, ignored instructions, or confirmed incorrect items.\n\nCATEGORY MAPPING GUIDELINES:\n- Use **\"N/A\"** when:\n  - There is a confirmed substitution or special instruction that was ignored\n  - The item is incorrect beyond doubt (even if the image proves it)\n- Use **\"Poor photo quality...\"** if:\n  - The image is too dark, blurry, unrelated, or irrelevant\n- Use **\"Miscategorized\"** if:\n  - The food is low quality, cold, missing (but unverifiable), poorly packaged, or no issue is found\n- Use **\"Incorrect size\"** if:\n  - Size mismatch is proven\n- Use **\"Explicit Photo/Comment\"** for:\n  - Inappropriate images or explicit language in the comment\n\nCHARGING RULES:\n- If the issue is a **confirmed substitution**, **ignored special instruction**, or **confirmed incorrect item received**, then → \"Charge\"\n- For all other issues → \"Do not charge\"\n\nREQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT IN JSON:\n{\n  \"analysis_summary\": \"<brief explanation of decision>\",\n  \"defect_category\": \"<one from the list above>\",\n  \"outcome\": \"<Charge/Do not charge>\"\n}\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Select ONLY ONE defect category or use \"N/A\" if clearly appropriate\n- Use exact category names as listed\n- Include clear justification in the summary (mention substitution, instruction, image clarity, etc.)"
